Jeeves is a very flexible application code generator. Its design
is extremely simple, but thanks to perl (perl 5), it packs quite
a punch.

The convenient thing about Jeeves is that unlike other code generators
I have seen, it does not prescribe a specification language - if you
have a parser for it, you can automatically generate a ton of code.
What code do you generate? Again, Jeeves leaves that up to you - you
fill in a template, and it does the rest.

If the above was not clear, then I recommend you read doc/jeeves.ps.
It gives details about code generation and the way Jeeves is structured. 

I don't have any time at all right now to create a reasonable user
manual; I do hope to fulfil this gap in the not-too-distant-future.

Meanwhile,

1. Read the document above.
2. In the examples/oo directory, assuming you are running csh,
   type "source run", and if it works for you , you should
   see *.C files. Compare that to the template.
   The example is explained in Jeeves.ps.
3. jeeves -h gives a usage.

I have tons of examples, but unfortunately I can't give them away
because the specification languages in those examples are somewhat
proprietary, and themselves would require too much documentation.

Suffice it to say that Jeeves is powerful enough to easily handle
automatic code generation off of CORBA IDL files. Again, I'd love
to make this public, but at this point I'd get into legal trouble 
with my employer if I do that.

Please let me know if you find Jeeves useful.
